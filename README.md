This project was built on google colab.
RAPIDS library was used for the purpose of performing GPU based operations
The project is going to be delivered in iterations
Simple data manupulation and all other tasks were done on simple python (pandas) after slicing the data and then the final steps were taken by using GPU.
Data was generated by using ttps://docs.bitbus.network/#/ and then normalized into different columns
Basic purpose was to create analytical reports and graphs to create some useful information and generate insights
